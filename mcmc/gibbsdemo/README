When I moved these demos to lewis I found 
that the nonplotting of the surface by 'clip'
did not wrok - the horrible surface showed up. 

So I tweaked the view angle and modified things to 
make it vanish. 

the old version which worked fine is *skye.m

9902

on feb 2000 I tried to improve the graphics handling 
and made changes to gibbs.m and DEMO.m, which 
are now kept in hacks.
Because I was failing to get it working quick, I 
reverted to DEMOskye.m, which is
now renamed DEMO.m

The data points in this example are  N=5:
{x} = 1.6, 0.4, 1.37, 0.63, 1.00        (x-bar = 1, sN = 0.45, sN-1 = 0.5)

on 2 march 2001 I made a major improvement, including
one-d mixture of gaussians modelling.
