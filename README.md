## Spectral Clustering (Soft K-means)

I felt there's no good python tutorial for spectral clustering. I had made it up by myself.  

The theory for clustering and soft k-means can be found at the [book](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/book.html "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms") of David Mackay.
